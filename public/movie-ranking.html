<h1>The Best Movies According To Damian Lee Pillay</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>3 - Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (Quentin Tarantino - 2019)</h3>
<p>
A captivating story with a stellar cast. 
The movie does a great job of setting the tone of 70's Hollywood perfectly, whilst developing characters that truly feel authentic. 
The slow but satisfying burn leads into an impactful climax, with an interesting 'What If?' twist on real life events of that era in hollywood.
A must watch movie for fans of time period fiction.

<h3>2 - Nope (Jordan Peele - 2022)</h3>
<p>
A unique take on psychological horror, that will leave you anxious the entire time (but in a good way!)
It's mysterious 'threat' is never full shown to you initially, other than blurs of motion and uniquely terrifying sound design. 
This coupled with its secluded setting and paradoxically calm pacing, create for an absolutely mindblowing reveal. Even when you think all his cards have been layed on the table,
Jordan Peele further surpasses your expectations with an absolute spectacle of cinematography and CGI its climactic show down. 
I would love to elaborate further, but this movie is best watched going in blindly.

<h3>1 - Whiplash (Damien Chazelle - 2014)</h3>
<p>
A gripping and frightening embodiment of how one's own passion can propell them into utter torment, in their mission of perfecting the craft.
A simple grounded story. No advanced CGI. No spectacle. just pure talent and performance from an exceptional cast. 
This movie will really bring into perspective, the abuse that someone is willing to go through for the sake of mastery, both physically and emotionally, 
as well as how one can lose everything else in the process. 
This movie takes you to outcomes you would never have expected for the protagonist, 
whilst he constantly perserveres through an abusive mentor and the disbelief of everyone close to him. 
Watch his rise, his fall, his revenge and ultimately his acceptance of who he is and what he was meant for, in his simple quest of becoming a professional drummer.
