<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"I'm Damian Lee Pillay, a mechanical engineering graduate and musician. I have recently developed a interest 
  in the world of IT and computer science. Through this, i have decided to learn as much as i can within the field, 
  which has taken this from an interest, to a strong passion. I am currently amidst learning
  many different facets of technology ranging from, machine learning to cloud computing to game development (and many more!).

<p>Hence, this is my portfolio showcasing every notable project i work on, throughout my coding journey</p>
